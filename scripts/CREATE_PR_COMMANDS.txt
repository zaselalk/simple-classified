Windows cmd commands to create branch, commit, push, and open a PR (uses GitHub CLI `gh` for PR creation):

cd C:\Users\ASUS\Desktop\simple-classified

REM create and switch to a new branch
git checkout -b improve-validation-and-safety

REM stage and commit changes
git add -A
git commit -m "Improve validation, session config, and harden controllers"

REM push and set upstream
git push -u origin improve-validation-and-safety

REM create PR using GitHub CLI; this will open an interactive prompt or create directly when flags are used
gh pr create --title "Improve validation, session config, and harden controllers" --body-file PR_DESCRIPTION.md --base main

REM Alternative if you don't have gh: open GitHub and create a pull request from the pushed branch, copying the contents of PR_DESCRIPTION.md into the PR body.
